# Minedev

Minedev is a VS Code extension that prevents developers from copying and pasting code without understanding the deep details of what they are implementing.

Minedev is an extension that has the ability to have a full context of the whole folder structure of a specific project.

## Features

- **Navigate** through files and suggests changes that depend on a specific change. Example: if a developer changes/adds/removes a specific code block that might have other references or other dependencies, Minedev will help the user navigate through files and suggest changes accordingly.
- **Chat with AI** that suggests code block examples instead of directly giving the finished code for the developer, this prevents the user from copying and pasting code or directly implementing code without understanding the deep details of how things are working. Moreover this will prevent developers from facing hours of debugging code they used without understanding it.
- **VoIP** feature allows the developer to chat with the AI model so that it will act as a pair programmer and help the developer have clear ideas and solutions on how things will work.
